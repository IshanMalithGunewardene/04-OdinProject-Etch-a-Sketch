To build an Etch-a-Sketch in JavaScript, hereâ€™s a short and sweet list of key concepts and tools to refer to:

1. **HTML Canvas** - Use the `<canvas>` element for drawing the grid and lines.
2. **JavaScript Events** - Handle keyboard input (`keydown` for arrow keys) or mouse events (`mousemove`, `mousedown`) for controls.
3. **2D Context** - Use `getContext('2d')` to draw lines and clear the canvas.
4. **State Management** - Track the current position (x, y) of the "pen."
5. **Line Drawing** - Use `beginPath()`, `moveTo()`, `lineTo()`, and `stroke()` for smooth lines.
6. **Reset Functionality** - Clear the canvas with `clearRect()` for the "shake" effect.
7. **CSS** - Style the canvas (border, size) and buttons if needed.
